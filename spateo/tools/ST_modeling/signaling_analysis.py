Additional functionalities to characterize signaling patterns from spatial transcriptomics

These include:
    - prediction of the effects of spatial perturbation on gene expression- this can include the effect of perturbing
    known regulators of ligand/receptor expression or the effect of perturbing the ligand/receptor itself.
    - following spatially-aware regression (or a sequence of spatially-aware regressions), combine regression results
    with data such that each cell can be associated with region-specific coefficient(s).
    - following spatially-aware regression (or a sequence of spatially-aware regressions), overlay the directionality
    of the predicted influence of the ligand on downstream expression.
